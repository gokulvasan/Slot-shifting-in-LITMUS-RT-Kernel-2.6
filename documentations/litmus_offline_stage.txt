Introduction
============

The offline part of the Slot Shifting implementation for Litmus^RT is described.

Framework Description
=====================

The offline phase of Slot Shifting guarantees the offline stages and calculates
the intervals and the spare capacities of each interval.

The Chair of Real Time Systems already has a program that executes these steps
(that we are going to call "offline_phase" here). It expects, as input, files in
the format which is output by another program: sam.

To inject the information calculated by the offline_phase into the kernel, we
created another program, called "ss_parser" here. The standard output of the
offline_phase, though, is not suited for our purposes. For this reason, some
changes in its output were done. These changes DON'T influence offline_phase's
behavior, but only output their calculated values in a different format. A
command line option to output the former format was inserted in the program.

In the following image, the entire framework is shown:

The ss_parser does its interaction with the kernel through system calls.
