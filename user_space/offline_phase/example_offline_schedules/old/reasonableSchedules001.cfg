#define TASKTYPE_APERIODIC 2


**requirements and solutions**

1.splitting of interval --> DL of aperiodic != DL of any interval
2.while shifting , maximum tasks and intervals should be shifted -- > intervals with 5 tasks having DLs > aperiodic.DL
3.possibility of shortening the DL --> wcet of aperiodic is satisfied in first intervals. --> 
    DL is shortened to the previous intervals END. so that no splitting is required ==> the tasks in the intervals > the DL of aperiodics need not be shifted
