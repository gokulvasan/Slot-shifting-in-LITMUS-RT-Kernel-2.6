***Description****

Simulation to test quicksort functionality

--> with quicksort: task 7 is the last to be sent to acceptance test,
                    hence will not be accepted
--> without quicksort: unlikely that task 7 is _last_ to be tested
                       if task 7 is accepted, max 6 additional aperiodic tasks can be accepted


LengthOfSimulation determines how many complete slots will be executed
(internally, the code counts like this: the very first interrupt leads to g_current_slot == 0
 after the <LengthOfSimulation>th slot, i.e. with g_current_slot == <LengthOfSimulation>
 the simulation ends and his in total simulated <LengthOfSimulation> slots)
