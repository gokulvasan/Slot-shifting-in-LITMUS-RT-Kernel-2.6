***Description****
MULTICORE0: aperiodic task scheduling only
this file is only to measure case A and C
results from case D should not be taken into account as this schedule lacks offline tasks
--> don't use this file, go for test_min_mean_max3.cfg as it
can also measure meaningful results for case D
