***Description****

Simulation to test deadline shortening functionality

--> with SDL: only task 3 gets accepted, as it shortens the DL, 
              it's not as flexible anymore, so task 4 cannot be accepted
--> without SDL: both aperiodic jobs get accepted


LengthOfSimulation determines how many complete slots will be executed
(internally, the code counts like this: the very first interrupt leads to g_current_slot == 0
 after the <LengthOfSimulation>th slot, i.e. with g_current_slot == <LengthOfSimulation>
 the simulation ends and his in total simulated <LengthOfSimulation> slots)
id,    core,    est,    wcet,    dl, type ; */
