***Description****

Simulation to test deadline shortening functionality

--> no new interval should be created


LengthOfSimulation determines how many complete slots will be executed
(internally, the code counts like this: the very first interrupt leads to g_current_slot == 0
 after the <LengthOfSimulation>th slot, i.e. with g_current_slot == <LengthOfSimulation>
 the simulation ends and his in total simulated <LengthOfSimulation> slots)
