Liblitmus Installation Instructions
===================================

Dependencies
------------

Liblitmus has no dependencies besides the kernel. During compilation, the
Makefile will attempt to copy required headers from the kernel source tree into
the library source tree.


Configuration
-------------

The build system reads a local configuration file named '.config' (just like the
kernel, but much simpler). There are three variables that affect the
compilation process:

	LITMUS_KERNEL --- Path (relative or absolute) to the LITMUS^RT kernel
	                  source tree. The default value is
	                  '../litmus2010'. Set this variable if you extracted
	                  the kernel somewhere else.

	ARCH          --- The target architecture. Currently, liblitmus can be
	                  build for i386, x86_64, sparc64, and arm.  The default
	                  value is the host architecture.

	CROSS_COMPILE --- A prefix for the compiler and linker to use. Works
	                  exactly like cross-compiling the kernel. By default,
	                  this variable is not set.

Makefile Targets
----------------

	all         --- Build the library, all tools, and all tests. This is
	                the default.

	lib         --- Build only the library.

	help	    --- Display this help.

	dump-config --- Report the build configuration. Use this to debug
	                build problems.

	clean       --- Remove all build files and binaries.

	TAGS        --- Create a TAGS file for emacs. (Requires etags to be
	                installed.)

	tags        --- Create a tags file for vim. (Requires ctags to be
	                installed.)

	cscope      --- Create a symbol database for cscope. (Requires cscope
	                to be installed.)
